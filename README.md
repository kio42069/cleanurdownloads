# cleanurdownloads
A simple Python script to organise your downloads folder

## Requirements
- You need to have python installed in your system
- This code was tested and created on a Windows system, so there's no guarantee if it will work on a Mac or a Linux system. It should ideally work, but no promises
- Download the provided python file in your donwloads directory (make sure the dowanloadsCleaner.py file itself is in downloads, and not in any subfolder)

## How to use (Method 1) (Easier)
- Simple click the python file to run it

## How to use (Method 2)
- Open up terminal, navigate to Downloads using cd
- run the given command
```
py downloadsCleaner.py
```
- After the terminal prints the success message, open up your file explorer and check for results


## How to extend the script to include custom file extensions 
It's a fairly simple code, and actually works on any folder to be used to organise. Just run in in the folder you want to organise.

Anyways back to customising the code, you simply need to add in the extension names required on the required lists. And if you want to add any new kind of folder, simply add it in the two lines where the folder names are declared. 

I will probably add a few comments to indicate where to edit the code incase it's not too clear
