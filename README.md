# Downloads Organizer

A simple Python script to organize your downloads folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- This script was developed and tested on a Windows system. While it should ideally work on other systems, compatibility is not guaranteed.

## Usage

- Run the script from any folder, and it will organize the **Downloads** folder.
- It scans the **Downloads** directory for files and categorizes them based on their file extensions into separate folders.

## Customizing File Extensions

To include custom file extensions:

1. **Open the Script:**
   - Open the Python script in a text editor or IDE.

2. **Edit File Extension Lists:**
   - Locate the section where file extensions are listed under different categories.
   - Add your desired file extensions to the respective lists.

3. **Adding New Folders:**
   - To add new folders for different file types:
     - Modify the `file_extensions` list by adding new entries for the desired category.
     - Update the folder creation section to include the new category.

## Additional Notes

- The script's functionality is tailored to organize the **Downloads** folder.
- If you encounter permission issues or specific file types not being organized, it might be due to file access restrictions.
- Comments have been added within the script to indicate areas that can be edited for customization.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs!
