# cleanurdownloads
A simple Python script to organise your downloads folder

## Requirements
- You need to have python installed in your system
- This code was tested and created on a Windows system, so there's no guarantee if it will work on a Mac or a Linux system. It should ideally work, but no promises
- Download the provided python file in your donwloads directory (make sure the dowanloadsCleaner.py file itself is in downloads, and not in any subfolder)

## How to use (Method 1)
- Open up terminal, navigate to Downloads using cd
- run the given command
```
py downloadsCleaner.py
```
- After the terminal prints the success message, open up your file explorer and check for results
